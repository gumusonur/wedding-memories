## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone and install**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd wedding-memories
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment and settings**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Cloudinary credentials
   # Edit config.ts for couple names and features
   ```

3. **Start development**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Open http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Configuration Files

**Environment Variables (.env)**

*For Cloudinary Storage:*
```bash
# Cloudinary Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=wedding
```

*For S3/Wasabi Storage:*
```bash
# AWS S3 / Wasabi Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.wasabisys.com  # Optional: for Wasabi or other S3-compatible services
```

**App Configuration (config.ts)**
```typescript
export enum StorageProvider {
  Cloudinary = 'cloudinary',
  S3 = 's3',
}

export const appConfig = {
  brideName: 'YourBrideName',
  groomName: 'YourGroomName',
  guestIsolation: false, // Set to true to filter photos by guest
  storage: StorageProvider.Cloudinary, // Storage provider selection
};
```

**Storage Providers**
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud-based media storage with automatic optimization, transformations, and blur placeholders for images/videos
- **S3/Wasabi**: Object storage compatible with AWS S3 API via secure proxy with request deduplication and stream handling
- **Seamless Switching**: Change providers instantly by updating `storage` config - no code changes required
- **Smart Media Handling**: Automatic optimization for Cloudinary, proxy-based serving for S3/Wasabi with progressive video loading
- **Feature Parity**: Download, external links, and all functionality work identically across providers

**S3/Wasabi Proxy Architecture**
- **Secure Proxy**: `/api/s3-proxy/[...path]` endpoint serves S3 media via server-side AWS SDK
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents multiple simultaneous requests for same file with buffer-based caching
- **CORS-Free**: Eliminates browser CORS issues by serving media from same origin
- **Permission Independent**: Works with private S3 buckets without public access policies
- **Stream Handling**: Proper ReadableStream consumption with buffer management
- **Download Support**: Automatic Content-Disposition headers for file downloads
- **High Performance**: 1-year cache headers with ETag support for optimal loading speed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and proper HTTP status codes

**Guest Isolation Mode**
- When `guestIsolation: true`, each guest only sees photos they uploaded
- When `guestIsolation: false`, all guests see all photos (default behavior)
- Server-side rendering shows empty gallery when isolation is enabled
